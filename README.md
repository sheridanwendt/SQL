This is a reference page for my ongoing [SQL repository](https://github.com/sheridanwendt/SQL) where I keep original transactional SQL queries that I have found useful in my IT career. Feel free to use or improve them.

## Sales Statistics

### Sales vs Sales Goal MTD
[Sales vs Sales Goal MTD.sql](https://github.com/sheridanwendt/sql)
This query assigns a goal of $1,000,000 as the sales goal for the month, adds up all sales for the month so far, and then compares it to where your sales should be at right now if you are on track with your sales goal. The results look like this:

#### Sales Goal     Todays Target      Gross Sales
1000000.00    500000.00          503000.00
